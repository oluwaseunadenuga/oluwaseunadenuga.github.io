**State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- Optimistic updates and caching strategies
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Background refetching and synchronization

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- RESTful API design with /api route prefix
- Middleware for request logging and error handling
- Development-optimized with Vite integration for HMR

**Data Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- Type-safe database operations with schema validation
- Migration support through drizzle-kit
- Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL integration

**Storage Strategy**: Hybrid approach with MemStorage for development
- In-memory storage implementation for rapid development
- Interface-based design allowing easy database integration
- CRUD operations for users and projects entities

### Development Environment

**Build System**: Vite with custom configuration
- Hot module replacement (HMR) for development
- Optimized production builds with code splitting
- Path aliases for clean import statements

**Development Tools**:
